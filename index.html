  <h3><u> Why i Joined Moringa : </u></h3>
  <p class="Reason"> The first and foremost reason i joined Moringa was because of a course they offered in 2016. <br>It was a 2-week bootcamp in which we would get to learn basic web development skills. </br>
   I had a profound feeling of achievement when i first styled and edited a document which would appear on a webpage.<br> Therefore, i planned on taking a full course on web-development after i had finished highschool. </br>
 I believe that after this course i will be able to secure a job and dwell into my career as a <strong> Web Developer</strong></p>
